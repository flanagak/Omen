# Omen  



Omen is an addon for Ashita v4 that creates a custom window to track the current floor's Primary and Secondary objectives.   
The addon also tracks time left and progress for secondary objectives.   

Text color, font size, background and window position can be configured inside the settings.lua file that gets created the first time you run the addon, alternatively the window can be dragged and dropped wherever on the screen.
